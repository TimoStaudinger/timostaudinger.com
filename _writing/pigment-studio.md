Designing and maintaining a consistent color palette for an application can be a
challenge. Colors and shades need harmonize well together, and they should be
used consistenly throughout the UI.

This is where PIGMENTstudio comes in. It helps you design a well-rounded set of
colors for your app, either from scratch, or from a template. The app then helps
you publish the swatches to share them with your team.
